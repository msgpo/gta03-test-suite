These files are part of openembedded:

  device_table-minimal.txt
  makedevs.c

Their purpose is to populate the /dev directory with device nodes
sufficient to start the system.  Later when udev is started the /dev
will be in /dev/.static/dev and a tmpfs will be mounted on /dev
which udev will administer.
